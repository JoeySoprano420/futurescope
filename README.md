The information collected by GPT-2 and the blockchain is typically used for different purposes in the application.

1. **Information from GPT-2:**
   - GPT-2 is used to generate creative and narrative content, such as comic scripts, based on the input provided. In the context of the provided code, the `GPT2Engine` class generates responses or comic scripts using the GPT-2 model. The generated content is then displayed using the GUI and may be stored or processed further based on your application's requirements.

2. **Information from Blockchain:**
   - The blockchain serves as a decentralized and distributed ledger to record transactions, user profiles, and potentially other relevant data. The blockchain's primary purposes include:
     - **Recording Transactions:** Each financial transaction or multimedia interaction is recorded in the blockchain, providing a transparent and immutable history.
     - **User Profiles:** User profiles are updated in the blockchain to include transaction history and other preferences, as seen in the provided code.
     - **Mining Blocks:** Optionally, the application may simulate a mining process, adding new blocks to the blockchain. This process helps maintain the integrity of the ledger.

As for where this information goes, it depends on your application's architecture and design:

- **Storage:** The information collected by GPT-2, such as generated scripts, can be stored locally or in a database for later retrieval or analysis.
  
- **Blockchain Network:** The blockchain, being decentralized, could be part of a network of nodes where each node maintains a copy of the ledger. The data is distributed across these nodes, providing redundancy and resilience.

- **User Interface:** Both GPT-2 generated content and blockchain data are likely presented to users through the application's user interface, such as the multimedia GUI in the provided code.

It's essential to design the integration points between these components based on your application's goals. The generated content might influence the blockchain data (e.g., updating user profiles), and the blockchain data might serve as a historical record for auditing or user reference. The specifics will depend on the use case and the features you want to provide to your users.

The infrastructure required for your application depends on various factors, including the scale of your project, user base, and the desired level of reliability and performance. Here are considerations for different components:

1. **GPT-2 Model:**
   - The GPT-2 model itself requires storage, typically on a server or cloud platform. Depending on the model size, you might need sufficient storage space to host and manage the pre-trained GPT-2 model.

2. **Blockchain:**
   - Running a blockchain network involves nodes that contribute to the decentralized ledger. These nodes could be hosted on servers or cloud instances. You might need storage for storing the blockchain data, and the data size grows as more transactions occur.

3. **User Data and Multimedia Content:**
   - User data, multimedia content, and other application-related data would require storage. The amount of storage needed depends on the volume of user interactions and the multimedia content being processed and stored.

4. **Servers:**
   - Servers are necessary for hosting various components of your application, including the GPT-2 model, blockchain nodes, databases, and potentially other services. The server infrastructure can be physical servers, virtual machines, or cloud-based instances.

5. **Database:**
   - Depending on your application's requirements, you might need a database to store user profiles, transaction history, and other relevant data. This could be a relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) or a NoSQL database (e.g., MongoDB).

6. **Cloud Services:**
   - Cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud provide scalable solutions for hosting servers, storage, databases, and other services. Cloud services offer flexibility, scalability, and can reduce the need for maintaining physical hardware.

7. **Networking:**
   - Consider the networking infrastructure for communication between components, users, and potentially other external services. This includes securing communication channels and ensuring low latency for a responsive user experience.

8. **Backup and Redundancy:**
   - Implementing backup strategies and redundancy measures is crucial for data integrity and system reliability. This might involve regular backups of critical data and the use of redundant servers or cloud instances.

9. **Security:**
   - Security measures, including firewalls, encryption, and access controls, are essential to protect user data, blockchain transactions, and other sensitive information.

10. **Scalability:**
    - Plan for scalability by designing your architecture to handle increased loads. This might involve load balancing, horizontal scaling, and optimizing the performance of critical components.

The specific choices you make will depend on your budget, technical expertise, and the specific requirements of your application. If you're starting with a smaller project, you can begin with a cloud-based solution and scale as your user base grows. If you anticipate high volumes of data, you might need to plan for more robust infrastructure.
